# Tools

This repository contains exercises, small projects, and playgrounds exploring advanced Python concepts and libraries. It is a work-in-progress for learning and practicing new Python skills.

## Achievements

- Accomplished foundational NumPy and data manipulation skills as measured by successful reshaping, slicing, and indexing of arrays, by creating multiple exercises and playground notebooks.  
- Used Python to experiment with data analysis, visualization, and automation that had a hands-on learning impact for advanced array operations and matrix handling.  
- Achieved 100% reproducibility of exercises across notebooks through proper use of functions, indexing, and random data generation.

## Topics & Libraries Explored

### NumPy

- Array creation and initialization (`zeros`, `ones`, `full`, `identity`)  
- Random arrays and integer sampling (`np.random.randint`, `np.random.rand`)  
- Reshaping, stacking, and broadcasting arrays (`reshape`, `vstack`, `hstack`)  
- Boolean masking and advanced indexing  
- Linear algebra operations (`matmul`, determinant)  
- Statistics (`min`, `max`, `sum` along axes)

### Python Fundamentals

- Itertools: grouping and processing lists  
- Copying vs referencing arrays (`copy()` method)  
- Boolean operations and masking  
- File handling (`np.genfromtxt` for CSV-like data)

## Projects & Exercises

- **NumPy Exercises**:  
  - Double border, cross pattern, and donut array manipulations  
  - Accessing specific rows, columns, and diagonals  
  - Boolean masking for filtering array values  
  - Reshaping 1D arrays into multi-row structures  
- **Mini Automation/Playgrounds**:  
  - Grouping names by first letter using `itertools.groupby`  
  - Experimenting with 3D arrays and advanced slicing  

## Tech Stack

- Libraries: NumPy, itertools  
- File Handling & I/O: CSV/Text data  
- Environment: Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to gradually build experience with advanced Python functionality, including:

- Data manipulation and array operations with NumPy  
- Boolean masking and conditional selection  
- Multi-dimensional array reshaping and stacking  
- Playground experiments for learning iteration, grouping, and slicing techniques
